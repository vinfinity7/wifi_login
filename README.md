# IIT BHU WiFi Login Electron Application

## **Introduction:**

The IIT BHU WiFi Login Electron Application is a project built using Electron.js, a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application is specifically designed to automate the process of logging into the WiFi network at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Banaras Hindu University (BHU). The application utilizes Axios for making HTTP requests to the firewall URL of the college WiFi.

## **Installation:**

To install the project dependencies, npm (Node Package Manager) is used. After cloning the project repository, navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary dependencies required for the project to run.

## **Starting the Application:**

Once the dependencies are installed, the application can be started using the following command:

```
npm start
```

This command will start the Electron application, and the main window of the application will appear on the screen.

## **Functionality:**

1. **Automated WiFi Login**: The main functionality of this application is to automate the process of logging into the WiFi network at IIT BHU. It achieves this by sending multiple Axios-based requests to the firewall URL of the college WiFi.

2. **HTTP Requests**: The application uses Axios, a popular HTTP client for making requests to the firewall URL. These requests include GET and POST requests to interact with the authentication system of the WiFi network.

3. **User Interface**: Although not explicitly mentioned, the application likely provides a user interface for users to input their credentials and initiate the login process. This interface may include input fields for username and password, as well as a button to trigger the login process.

## **Incomplete Logic:**

While the project has been outlined and partially implemented, there may be some areas where attention to detail in the logic part is lacking. This could include error handling, edge cases, and ensuring the robustness of the application under various scenarios such as network connectivity issues or incorrect user inputs.

## **Conclusion:**

The IIT BHU WiFi Login Electron Application is a work-in-progress project aimed at automating the login process for the WiFi network at IIT BHU. By leveraging Electron.js and Axios, the application simplifies the process for users, eliminating the need for manual intervention during the authentication process. With further refinement and attention to detail in the logic part, the application has the potential to offer a seamless and reliable solution for accessing the college WiFi network.
